Controller

    When user is sent to the individual project sites load the appropriate JSON data within the site

BLOG

- Parse Data
- Design BLOG


Self-Note:

Can use show and hide functions
Maybe toggle the functions? if the blog one is focused show the minimal description and so on


Maybe:

A single JSON to control everything that would update values based on the site?
Add an admin site that manages things for JSON instead of counting on PostMaker and make PostMaker a project of its own
This way the github page could be controlled on its own rather than counting on Postmaker


ON MAIN PAGE LOAD

GET ANY NEW DATA FROM JSON DATA(CREATE)
THEN PUSH IT TO THE BLOG-DATA
THEN USE THE BLOG DATA
