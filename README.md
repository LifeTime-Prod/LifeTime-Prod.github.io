## Personal Site

"Should have used Jekyll" - Yes, but no. Let me ~~suffer~~ **Learn**

My initial plan before everything was to make a devlog site that just show cases my projects
but as it turns out. I could only use js, html and css on github pages. Don't get me wrong I'm absolutely grateful that I can do 
something like this for free!

Since I'm currently learning Laravel, Using that would have been nice but since I can't do that. Thought of a work around using
JSON. "What about Jekyll" well I didn't learn about that until I finished planning. 

My plan is to use Java to make own GUI tool that would show me how it would look like and then have that
tool export/edit the JSON the website is using to "generate" the contents.
